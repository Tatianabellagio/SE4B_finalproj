# buttRflyfish

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Tatianabellagio/SE4B_finalproj/master?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the data and code for our package
`buttRflyfish`, which replicates the central plot in Figure 2B from
[Nowicki et al. 2020: “Gene expression correlates of social evolution in
coral reef buttefly
fishes”](https://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frspb.2020.0239). The authors use a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo model to analyze qRT-PCR data for neuropeptide
expression in different brain regions of social butterfly fish using the
package `MCMC.qpcr`. Figure 2B illustrates that fish homologue of
mammalian oxytocin receptor (OTR) is downregulated in the of
supracommisural part of the ventral telencephalon in solitary butterfly
fish species.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
-   [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
-   [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations
-   [:file\_folder:
    supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):
    Supplementary materials including notes and other documents prepared
    and collected during the analysis.

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj`
file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, open
`analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run
`rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console
